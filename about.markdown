Tech Updates are the weekly updates managed by Polyrific's Department of Technology sent initially via emails to the internal Polyrific employees.
However, emails are quickly buried and forgotten. So we created this website to gather the updates so they can be referenced for future needs.

Tech Updates usually contain some sections, but we only include two of them in this web version: the key topic and tech news.
The key topic is the main issue that has been the week's highlight. Tech news contains external articles about technology and software development topics from various sources worldwide that we think are useful to increase our knowledge.
