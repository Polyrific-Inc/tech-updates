## IE 11 End of Support

Last year, Microsoft officially [announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/) the end of support of the Desktop Internet Explorer 11, which will be on June 15, 2022. You can read the full explanation on the announcement. But, what does it mean for us?

1. You should not use IE 11 anymore in your daily work activities; use the modern browsers instead (Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge) for better features and security support. If, for any reason, you still need to use IE 11, please consult with the TECH team to find better solutions.
2. All internal tools and services used in Polyrific don't have a specific requirement for the IE 11, so there shouldn't be any concern if we should restrict the usage of this browser now in the company.
3. You will not be able to use LastPass as IE 11 extension as [they are stopping their support for this browser](https://support.lastpass.com/help/lastpass-for-internet-explorer-11-no-longer-supported). If you've installed the extension in any other modern browsers, you should be good to go.
4. If there's a left-over requirement in any project to support IE 11, please educate the clients regarding this sunset announcement and explain why they need to consider dropping the requirement.
5. No more extra work is needed for the developers and testers to make their apps play nice with this old browser. Everybody can smile now :)

RIP IE11! Oh btw, someone has creatively created a countdown for this event [https://death-to-ie11.com/](https://death-to-ie11.com/).
